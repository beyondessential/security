# Bug bounties

BES does not operate a bug bounty program.

## Beg bounties

[Beg bounties](https://www.troyhunt.com/beg-bounties/) will not be accepted either.

By all means, if you find an *actual* security vulnerability then contact us and tell us what it is.
If you find something awesome then we'd love to send you some stickers.
But if you've just run some automated tooling, found something trivial then reached out with the expectation of cashing in, you're going to be disappointed.
